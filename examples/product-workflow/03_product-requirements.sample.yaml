  overview:
    problemStatement: "Mission authors need a cohesive product experience that connects discovery insights to execution-ready missions without manual stitching."
    targetAudience: "Mission authors, product strategists, and intelligence program admins."
    strategicFit: "Unlocks telemetry monetization strategy and accelerates cross-discipline mission throughput."
  goalsAndMetrics:
    businessGoals:
      - "Increase mission throughput by 30% within six months of launch."
      - "Unlock upsell path for intelligence insights with packaged dashboard."
    userOutcomes:
      - "Mission authors receive pre-filled drafts with linked evidence."
      - "Product leadership monitors adoption and quality without analyst intervention."
    measurableKPIs:
      - "70% of missions generated via guided workflows."
      - "<12h average time from discovery artifact completion to mission handoff."
  assumptionsAndDependencies:
    assumptions:
      - "Telemetry data lake refreshes remain sub-hour."
      - "Domain pack registry stays stable across sprints."
    dependencies:
      - "Data warehouse modeling for mission insights."
      - "Design system updates for dashboard components."
      - "Change management support for author onboarding."
  requirements:
    userStories:
      - "As a mission author, I want recommended domain pack scaffolds so that I can start execution quickly."
      - "As a product strategist, I want dashboard alerts when insight adoption drops so that I can prioritize enablement."
      - "As an admin, I want to configure telemetry thresholds so that I can tune insight quality."
    functional:
      - "Surface recommended missions via mission protocol CLI and web console."
      - "Expose REST API for dashboard metric aggregation."
      - "Allow configuration of telemetry-driven nudges per domain pack."
    nonFunctional:
      - "P95 mission drafting latency under 3 seconds."
      - "Dashboard refresh cadence every 15 minutes with graceful degradation."
      - "Comply with SOC2 change management controls."
  scope:
    inScope:
      - "Guided mission creation experience for discovery and engineering packs."
      - "Executive dashboard with adoption and quality metrics."
      - "Telemetry alerts integrated with Slack."
    outOfScope:
      - "Expansion to external partner ecosystems."
      - "Machine-learning generated insight narratives."
      - "Mobile-native authoring experience."
