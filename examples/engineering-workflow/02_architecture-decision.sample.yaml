    - "sample-engineering-tdd"
    - "Platform capacity review 2025-10-18"
  constraints:
    - "Decision required before code freeze to unblock infrastructure work."
successCriteria:
  - "Capture decision rationale aligned with business and technical goals."
  - "Enumerate consequences with mitigation strategies."
  - "Document reviewers and approval timestamp within accompanying checklist."
deliverables:
  - "Signed ADR with context and consequences"
  - "Follow-up tasks for infrastructure and observability"

  title: "ADR-2025-10: Host scoring in adapter worker tier"
  status: "Accepted"
  decision: "Run the workflow intelligence scoring engine in dedicated adapter workers managed by the mission telemetry queue."
  consequences:
    - "Positive: Reuses existing worker autoscaling and isolates compute spikes from mission protocol server."
    - "Positive: Enables feature flag rollout of new scoring heuristics."
    - "Negative: Requires new observability dashboards for worker throughput."
    - "Neutral: Increases queue dependency footprint but remains inside current SLOs."
