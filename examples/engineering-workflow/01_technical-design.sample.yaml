schemaVersion: "2.0"
missionId: "sample-engineering-tdd"
objective: "Produce the technical design for the workflow intelligence adapter before implementation."
context:
  background: "Sprint 4 introduced intelligence tooling that now requires a dedicated adapter to surface domain pack insights to mission authors."
  dependencies:
    - "PRD-20251020 Workflow Intelligence Adapter"
    - "Architecture review notes from Sprint 4 Phase 1"
  constraints:
    - "Design must be implementation-ready for the next sprint boundary."
successCriteria:
  - "Document high-level system and component diagrams that align with architecture standards."
  - "Capture API surfaces, data contracts, and integration points for the adapter."
  - "List risks with mitigation paths before kickoff."
deliverables:
  - "Technical design document covering architecture, data, and interfaces"
  - "Component inventory with dependencies"
  - "Risk register with mitigation owners"

  risksAndAlternatives:
    potentialRisks:
      - "Telemetry volume spikes could overload scoring workers."
      - "Adapter may expose stale pack metadata without cache invalidation."
    alternativesConsidered:
      - "Embed scoring directly within mission protocol server to avoid async worker farm."
      - "Use polling instead of webhooks for telemetry ingestion."
