schemaVersion: "2.0"
missionId: "sample-process-design-review"
objective: "Facilitate a structured design review for the workflow intelligence adapter surfaces."
context:
  background: "Architecture and product stakeholders requested a rapid design checkpoint before implementation begins."
  dependencies:
    - "sample-engineering-tdd"
    - "sample-engineering-adr"
  constraints:
    - "Design feedback must land before code review sign-off."
successCriteria:
  - "Capture structured feedback across visuals, UX, and content."
  - "Assign actionable follow-ups to the design and engineering owners."
  - "Record approval disposition for the sprint checkpoint."
deliverables:
  - "Design review notes with action items"
  - "Updated mockups reflecting prioritized feedback"

  projectContext:
    projectName: "Workflow Intelligence Adapter"
    linkToPRD: "PRD-20251020"
    reviewGoals:
      - "Validate empty and loading states for the author console surface."
      - "Confirm accessibility heuristics meet design system baselines."
  designPresentation: "https://figma.example.com/file/workflow-intelligence-adapter"
  reviewCriteria:
    visuals: "Layout aligns with mission protocol design system spacing and color tokens."
    ux: "Stepper navigation clarifies mission readiness and uses inline help for domain guidance."
    content: "Copy references key telemetry language and avoids internal jargon."
  structuredFeedback:
    whatWorksWell:
      - "Timeline visualization cleanly communicates mission readiness signals."
      - "Inline pack guidance cards reduce author lookup time."
    areasForImprovement:
      - "Contrast ratio on the warning banner fails AA threshold."
      - "Surface needs keyboard shortcuts for switching mission views."
    openQuestions:
      - "Should the adapter expose export actions from this screen?"
      - "Do we need a tutorial overlay for first-time authors?"
  actionItems:
    - task: "Update warning banner colors to meet AA contrast."
      owner: "Design Lead"
    - task: "Prototype keyboard navigation flow for mission tab switcher."
