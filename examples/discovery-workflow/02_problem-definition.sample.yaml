missionId: "sample-discovery-problem-definition"
objective: "Express the validated mission author workflow problem with measurable outcomes."
context:
  background: "Opportunity scan confirmed authors lose context when switching from discovery artifacts to mission templates."
  dependencies:
    - "sample-discovery-opportunity-scan"
  constraints:
    - "Problem statement must align with Platform Intelligence OKRs."
successCriteria:
  - "Document a crisp problem statement naming actor, broken step, and desired outcome."
  - "Capture evidence that supports or challenges the problem framing."
deliverables:
  - "Problem definition brief"
  - "Evidence appendix with annotated sources"

    sessionObjectives:
      - "Lock in a machine-readable problem statement for workflow intelligence assistant."
    sessionOptimization:
      guidelines:
        - "Use exact role titles from discovery interviews."
        - "Reference specific workflow steps and evidence."
  problemStatement: "Mission authors lack guided translation from discovery packs to execution-ready missions, creating 4h/week of avoidable rework."
  actorAndAction:
    actor: "Mission Author (Product Discovery Pod)"
    currentWorkflow:
      - "Compile discovery outputs across packs."
      - "Cross-map findings into mission template fields."
      - "Review with engineering lead for feasibility."
    brokenStep: "Cross-mapping findings into mission template fields."
    desiredOutcome: "Automatically suggested mission scaffolds with linked evidence."
  evidence:
    - "Interview transcript: author struggles aligning discovery outputs to mission template."
    - "Telemetry: 3.8h average per mission to reconcile domain fields."
    - "Sprint retro action: request for guided workflow."
  solutionSpace:
    existingSolutions: "Manual spreadsheets, shared Notion checklists."
    whyTheyFail: "Go stale quickly and require constant manual updates."
    ourAngle: "Intelligence assistant using domain pack metadata to pre-fill mission scaffolds."
  scopeSizing:
    smallestValuableSolution: "Guided mission creation wizard seeded by discovery packs."
    fullVision: "Adaptive assistant that monitors discovery progress and updates mission drafts."
    firstMilestone: "Generate draft mission with linked evidence for one discovery pod."
