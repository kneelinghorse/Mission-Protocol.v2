schemaVersion: "2.0"
missionId: "sample-discovery-opportunity-scan"
objective: "Decide whether to pursue a workflow intelligence assistant for mission authors."
context:
  background: "Sprint 4 research surfaced recurring friction in translating discovery findings into execution-ready missions."
  dependencies:
    - "CSA-20251026 discovery interviews"
  constraints:
    - "Decision needed before Sprint 4 build allocation lock."
successCriteria:
  - "Document a clear go/no-go recommendation with supporting evidence."
  - "List the highest-signal research leads for deeper investigation."
deliverables:
  - "Rapid opportunity scan notes"
  - "Short list of recommended research sub-missions"

    unit: "AI_session"
    sessionObjectives:
      - "Determine if workflow intelligence assistant solves a critical author pain."
    sessionOptimization:
      guidelines:
        - "Favor high-signal, low-effort sources such as recent triage reports."
        - "Stop once a confident yes/no recommendation emerges."
    contextInputs:
      - "Mission backlog analytics from October sprint reviews."
  signal:
    source: "Backlog triage and author feedback sync"
    observation: "Authors spend ~4 hours/week aligning discovery findings with mission fields."
    pattern: "Pain intensifies during sprint transitions with new domain packs."
  stakes:
    affectedActors: "Mission authors, sprint planners, discovery researchers"
    costOfInaction: "Continued 4h/week drag per author, delaying Phase 2 missions"
    currentAlternatives: "Manual spreadsheet checklists maintained by leads"
  feasibilitySniffTest:
    technicalBarriers: "Requires surfacing existing pack metadata via MCP tools."
    marketReadiness: "Internal teams actively searching for acceleration tooling."
    resourceRequirements: "One sprint for prototype, shared with Domain Pack Integration work."
