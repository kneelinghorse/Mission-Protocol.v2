objective: "Synthesize discovery findings and issue a go/no-go decision for the workflow intelligence assistant."
context:
  background: "All five research lenses submitted preliminary readouts for the assistant concept."
  dependencies:
    - "sample-discovery-research-orchestrator"
  constraints:
    - "Decision feeds Sprint 4 engineering capacity planning."
successCriteria:
  - "Score each discovery lens with clear justification."
  - "Document the final go/no-go call with next steps and risks."

  scoringDimensions:
    - dimension: "1. Problem Validation"
      keyEvidence: "Authors report 4h/week saved with assistant prototype."
      justification: "Quant + qual agreement on pain severity."
      score: 4
    - dimension: "2. Solution Feasibility"
      keyEvidence: "Telemetry APIs and MCP tools already expose required data."
      justification: "Requires incremental integration effort."
      score: 3
    - dimension: "3. Market Readiness"
      keyEvidence: "Comparable tooling adoption in adjacent teams within last quarter."
      justification: "Positive trend but needs pilot success for proof."
      score: 3
    - dimension: "4. Economic Viability"
      keyEvidence: "Projected 3x ROI via reduced authoring time and faster mission throughput."
      justification: "ROI assumes maintaining telemetry instrumentation."
