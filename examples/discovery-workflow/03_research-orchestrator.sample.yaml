    notes: "R1 interviews underway; R3 awaiting telemetry instrumentation from B4.1."
  crossValidation:
    contradictions:
      - "Interview team reports faster turnaround with custom sheets vs. telemetry time logs."
    resolutions:
      - "Schedule joint review with telemetry team to reconcile data sources."
  synthesis:
    keyFindings:
      - "Authors want automated scaffolding but fear losing context."
    risksAndUnknowns:
      - "Need clarity on integrating new assistant into existing mission authoring flow."
