# Quality Scoring System Implementation

Sprint 3 delivered the three-dimensional quality scoring engine that powers the `get_mission_quality_score` MCP tool. The implementation combines clarity, completeness, and AI-readiness analysis, surfaces actionable guidance, and maintains sub-10 ms execution for typical missions.

## Architecture Overview

- **QualityScorer** (`src/quality/quality-scorer.ts`) orchestrates the analyzers, computes weighted scores, and enforces performance targets (default 3000 ms). It exposes `score`, `calculateMaintainabilityIndex`, and `suggestImprovements`.
- **Clarity Analyzer** (`src/quality/analyzers/clarity-analyzer.ts`) measures lexical density, readability, ambiguity, and Mission Cyclomatic Complexity (MCC). Risk metadata drives downstream recommendations.
- **Completeness Analyzer** (`src/quality/analyzers/completeness-analyzer.ts`) checks schema coverage, information breadth, dependency references, and evidence density.
- **AI-Readiness Analyzer** (`src/quality/analyzers/ai-readiness-analyzer.ts`) validates YAML structure, instruction specificity, and formatting consistency; syntactic failures emit critical blocking feedback.
- **Improvement Engine** (`src/quality/improvement-engine.ts`) maps analyzer metrics to severity-ranked suggestions using rule definitions and contextual mission data.
- **Types & Weights** (`src/quality/types.ts`) define the scoring schema, default weights, and metric metadata that power both analyzers and reporting surfaces.

## MCP Integration

- **Tool Registration** (`src/tools/score-quality.ts`) exposes the canonical `get_mission_quality_score` tool and maintains the `score_quality` alias with runtime deprecation warnings.
- **Server Wiring** (`src/index.ts`) loads the tool definition, ensures compatibility with the TokenizerFactory, and emits telemetry for instrumentation consumers.
- **Snapshots & Contracts** (`tests/snapshots/tool-definitions.snap`) hold regression coverage so schema changes require explicit approval.

## Testing & Quality Gates

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/quality/*.test.ts`) cover analyzers, the improvement engine, and aggregate scoring behaviour.
- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/quality-scoring.test.ts`) assess end-to-end scoring against representative missions and ensure suggestion ordering remains deterministic.
- **Static Analysis** (`npm run lint`, `npm run format:check`) enforces the Sprint 4 quality baseline; `npm run snapshots` guards MCP tool contracts.
- **Metrics Reporting** (`npm run metrics`) records complexity insights in `artifacts/quality-metrics/latest.json`, including analyzer hot spots.

The Sprint 3 completion run reported 801/801 Jest tests passing with ~94 % statement coverage and <10 ms average scoring latency on medium missions.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { QualityScorer } from '../src/quality/quality-scorer';

const scorer = new QualityScorer();
const report = await scorer.score(missionContent, 'B4.6');

console.log(`Quality: ${(report.total * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
for (const suggestion of report.suggestions) {
  console.log(`${suggestion.severity.toUpperCase()}: ${suggestion.message}`);
}
```

MCP clients call the tool through `get_mission_quality_score` (or legacy `score_quality`) with a `missionFile` argument; verbose mode returns dimensional metrics, maintainability index, and suggestion payloads.

## Known Limitations

- Benchmark dimension remains stubbed until the gold-standard corpus lands (tracked for Sprint 5).
- Ambiguity detection relies on heuristics; ML-assisted refinement is deferred.
- English language focus; localisation hooks exist but lack backed data.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate benchmark datasets once R5 missions complete the corpus.
- Expand suggestion library with auto-fix primitives for common clarity issues.
- Surface trend analytics by persisting recent scores for each mission.
