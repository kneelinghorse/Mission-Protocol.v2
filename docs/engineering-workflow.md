# Engineering Workflow Integration

The engineering and process domain packs extend the discovery workflow by codifying how technical decisions move from design to production-ready execution. Sprint 4 Phase 2 adds five packs that cover design sign-off, decision records, implementation readiness, review, and remediation.

## Pack Progression

1. **TDD Blueprint** (`engineering.tdd`) produces the system, data, and interface design needed before implementation begins.
2. **Architecture Decision Record** (`engineering.adr`) documents critical platform choices that emerge from design trade-offs.
3. **Design Review** (`process.design-review`) captures stakeholder feedback and action items before development starts.
4. **Code Review** (`process.code-review`) ensures the implementation adheres to quality, security, and documentation standards.
5. **Bug Fix Lifecycle** (`engineering.bug-fix`) records remediation work when issues surface during validation and rollout.

The sample missions under `examples/engineering-workflow/` demonstrate how artifacts flow between stages. Each mission references the prior stage in `context.dependencies`, illustrating how the packs coordinate.

## Validation Guardrails

- Run `npm run test -- tests/smoke/engineering-domain-packs-smoke.test.ts` to ensure the engineering packs load correctly and the samples populate all required fields.
- Run `npm run validate:packs` to confirm registry metadata stays aligned with both discovery and engineering workflow samples.
- Optional: Execute `npm run metrics` after updates to surface token and quality metrics for the new packs.
