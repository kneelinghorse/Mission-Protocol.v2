missionId: "QA-AGENTIC"
objective: "Validate that Mission Protocol tooling consumes CMOS agent memory guidance without drift."

context: |
  CMOS working memory now feeds Mission Protocol analytics, and we need assurance that the data exchange stays aligned.
  This sample mission exercises the agents.md loader together with mission outcome analytics to confirm telemetry and
  status data stay synchronized between both systems.

successCriteria:
  - "AgentsMdLoader loads sample guidance and emits a context patch with agents_md_loaded=true."
  - "Mission outcome analytics reflects the same active mission state recorded in CMOS working memory."
  - "Telemetry attributes capture loader duration and backlog totals within expected thresholds."

deliverables:
  - "Automated interoperability test covering loader + analytics handshake."
  - "Sample backlog + sessions fixtures capturing joint mission states."
  - "Documentation snippet describing handshake validation steps."

domainFields:
  type: "QA.AgenticIntegration.v1"
  qaChecks:
    - "Assert agents.md loader produces expected context patch."
    - "Verify mission outcome analytics mirrors CMOS backlog statuses."
    - "Confirm agent identifiers match between sessions log and analytics output."
  telemetryExpectations:
    - "Loader metrics include agents.md bytes read and load duration."
    - "Analytics export summarizes completed, in-progress, and queued mission totals."
