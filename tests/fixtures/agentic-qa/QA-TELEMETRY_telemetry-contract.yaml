missionId: "QA-TELEMETRY"
objective: "Ensure joint QA telemetry stays aligned between CMOS session logs and Mission Protocol analytics exports."

context: |
  The interoperability harness depends on consistent telemetry fields and timing between CMOS and Mission Protocol.
  This mission captures the expectations for event shape, timing metadata, and regression alerts when telemetry drifts.

successCriteria:
  - "Sessions JSONL events include mission id, action, status, and summary fields for every run."
  - "Mission outcome analytics aggregates telemetry without losing active mission state."
  - "QA harness surfaces deltas when telemetry structure or counts fall outside thresholds."

deliverables:
  - "Telemetry schema assertions inside interoperability integration tests."
  - "Sample sessions.jsonl illustrating start, complete, and in-progress events."
  - "Threshold configuration for alerting on telemetry regressions."

domainFields:
  type: "QA.AgenticIntegration.v1"
  qaChecks:
    - "Validate sessions.jsonl entries remain append-only and well-formed."
    - "Cross-check analytics output against telemetry expectations."
    - "Alert when missing missions or time gaps exceed tolerance."
  telemetryExpectations:
    - "Record loader + analytics duration metrics per run."
    - "Emit mission throughput counts covering completed and active work."
