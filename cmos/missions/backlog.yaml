objective: "To successfully track, manage, and complete all planned development sprints, from Sprint 1 (Foundation) through Sprint 5 (Process Intelligence)."

context: |
  This mission file represents the master backlog and sprint plan for the Mission Creation Protocol (MCP) project.
  It provides a single source of truth for what has been completed, what is in progress, and what is planned.
  This structured format allows for automated status tracking and dependency management.

successCriteria:
  - "All missions within Sprint 1 are marked as 'Completed'."
  - "All missions within Sprint 2 are marked as 'Completed'."
  - "All missions within Sprint 3 are marked as 'Completed'."
  - "All missions within Sprint 4 are successfully moved through 'Current' to 'Completed' status."
  - "All missions within Sprint 5 are successfully moved through 'Current' to 'Completed' status."

deliverables:
  - "A fully updated version of this mission file with all sprints marked as complete."
